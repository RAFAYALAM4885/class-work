          Chrysler Pacifica</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Practical, comfortable, graceful, and undeniably handsome, the 2022 Chrysler Pacifica has family transportation down pat. It's offered with either a regular V-6 or a plug-in hybrid powertrain, and can be equipped with optional all-wheel drive. Its refined road manners make the Pacifica a pleasure to drive, whether you're logging interstate road-trip miles or simply shuttling kids to the high school football game, making it worthy of an Editors' Choice award. </p>

          Kia Carnival</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The makeover of Kia's minivan is such a dramatic one that it even includes an all-new name: Carnival. The 2022 Carnival replaces the aging Sedona in Kia's lineup and its boxy SUV-like styling is no accident, as the Korean automaker aims to capitalize on the success of its critically-acclaimed and hot-selling Telluride SUV. Large wheels, crossover-like proportions, and signature daytime running lights that flow into the grille give the van an upscale-SUV vibe that reminds us of a Range Rover. </p>

          Toyota Sienna</h5>
        <p class="card-text">If you think that the 2022 Sienna looks more like an SUV than a minivan, that was Toyota's intent. Although the sliding side doors are a giveaway, the van's muscular body sides, roof rack, and flat hood help it blend in with the brand's other SUVs such as the mid-size Highlander and the full-size Sequoia.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Chevy Camaro ZL1</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The 2022 Chevy Camaro ZL1 isn't the most powerful muscle car, but when it comes to driver involvement and value for the performance, it's unbeatable. It's also on our 2022 Editors' Choice list. The bow-tie boys stuff a 650-hp supercharged V-8 between the ZL1's fenders and offer a satisfying manual transmission or a snappy 10-speed automatic. Sure, the Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 packs a 760-hp V-8 and its own incredible track capabilities, but it doesn't offer a stick-shift or a convertible body style. Plus, unlocking the Shelby's full potential costs considerably more than the Camaro's transformative 1LE package. </p>

          Ford Mustang Shelby GT500</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Think of the 2022 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 kind of like a rolling theme park. Its monstrous 760-hp supercharged V-8 launches the coupe with eye-watering force, and its immense grip causes sensations of euphoria or nausea or both. All the while its thrilling exhaust note provides the soundtrack, and a rapid-shifting automatic transmission handles gearchanges for the rear-drive-only coupe. The Shelby GT500 isn't just the mightiest Mustang ever, it's also the most powerful road car Ford has ever built. We named it to our 2022 Editors' Choice list, too. </p>

          McLaren 720S</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Like many exotic cars, the 2022 McLaren 720S offers a lot of show and serious go. The thrills include explosive launches and the kind of ethereal agility that'll send serious drivers into ecstasy. At the heart of McLaren's lightweight, carbon-fiber-intensive dream machine is a 710-hp twin-turbo V-8. While the engine has considerable turbo lag, the short pause after you stomp the accelerator allows a beat to prepare for a rush to 100 mph in just 5.2 seconds and the ability to reach a claimed 212 mph. </p>

          Hyundai Santa Cruz</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The 2022 Ferrari F8 Tributo and Spider epitomize the supercar formula. They both have looks that kill, the most power-dense V-8 that Ferrari has ever built, and handling that's more akin to donning a superhero's suit than driving a car. While the Italian automaker has built V-8s that sound better than the F8's twin-turbo 3.9-liter, the 710 horsepower it sends to the rear tires contributes to exhilarating take-offs and the sense you’re flying low to the ground. Whether drivers opt for the convertible Spider or the hardtop Tributo, the epic power, stout chassis, and neck-straining cornering grip will make them work to extract the car's full potential.</p>

          Rivian R1T</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Maserati has been teasing us with the new MC20 mid-engine sports car for some time now, and we've finally driven this sweet little cannoli and sampled its novel 621-hp twin-turbo V-6. The MC20 is offered as a two-seater coupe with a minimalist cabin that's focused on the driver; a convertible is expected to join the lineup later and eventually an electric MC20 will reach production too. </p>

          GMC Canyon</h5>
        <p class="card-text">With an exclusive naturally aspirated engine and race car-inspired components, the 2022 Porsche 911 GT3 is optimized for driver engagement and track-day glory. Porsche enhances its most visceral 911 variant with a control-arm front suspension—the first on a 911 road car—and an unusual rear wing that's mounted at the top instead of the bottom. The GT3 is also the only 911 that's not turbocharged, and the responsive nature and immersive sounds of its 502-hp 4.0-liter flat-six qualify as inspirational.</p>
